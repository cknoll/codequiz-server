This folder is used to store configuration files.

These files are used while developing or deploying your Django project,
so mainly they are webserver configurations.

Please note, that only files with the suffix .sample are included in VCS. For
security reasons, you should not expose your webserver configuration to the
public, so I highly recommend to NOT include your config files in VCS if your
VCS is publicly accessible (i.e. via GitHub).
